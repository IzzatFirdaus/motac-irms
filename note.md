Okay, this is a significant architectural change for the MOTAC Integrated Resource Management System, transitioning it from a dual-purpose system (Email/User ID Provisioning & ICT Equipment Loan) to a focused ICT Loan and new Helpdesk system. This requires careful planning and execution.



Here's a detailed plan for the 4.0 version, outlining how to separate and remove Email Application components and integrate a new Helpdesk system.



MOTAC Integrated Resource Management System (Version 4.0) - Refactoring & New Feature Integration Plan



Goals for Version 4.0:



Remove Email/User ID Provisioning: Eliminate all code, database tables, and UI elements related to the Email/User ID Provisioning module.



Integrate Helpdesk System: Introduce a new Helpdesk module to manage IT support tickets.



Maintain ICT Equipment Loan Management: Ensure the existing ICT Equipment Loan Management system remains fully functional and robust.



Phase 1: Planning and Preparation (Critical for Success)



Verify Scope and Requirements:



Email Removal: Confirm with stakeholders that all Email/User ID Provisioning functionality is to be removed, including historical data access if applicable.



Helpdesk Integration: Get a clear high-level understanding of the required Helpdesk features (e.g., ticket creation, assignment, status tracking, comments, attachments, reporting, user roles for agents/users). This plan assumes basic ticketing features.



Impact Assessment: Conduct a thorough review of shared components (e.g., User model, notifications) to understand how their dependencies will be affected by removing the email module and adding helpdesk.



Version Control Strategy:



Create a new branch: All work for v4.0 should be done on a dedicated branch (e.g., feature/v4.0-helpdesk-refactor) derived from the stable main or develop branch of v3.6.



Regular Commits: Commit small, logical changes frequently.



Backup Data & Code:



Perform a full database backup of the v3.6 system.



Ensure the current v3.6 codebase is committed and tagged.



Environment Setup:



Set up a dedicated development environment for v4.0 (ideally Dockerized as per system design).



Ensure all necessary tools (PHP, Composer, Node.js, npm, database client) are in place.



Phase 2: Removing Email Application Components (Refactoring & Deletion)



This phase focuses on surgically removing the email provisioning module while minimizing impact on the loan module.



2.1 Database Schema Clean-up (Models & Migrations)



Identify & Isolate:



email_applications table: This table is directly tied to the email provisioning.



users table: Examine motac_email, user_id_assigned, previous_department_name, previous_department_email, service_status, appointment_type fields. If these fields are exclusively used by the email provisioning module and have no other purpose for HRMS or Loan, they should be removed. Otherwise, they might need to be repurposed or retained. Assume for this plan that motac_email and user_id_assigned are removable, and others might be kept for general HR purposes.



approvals table: This is polymorphic. Review its relationship with EmailApplication. The polymorphic setup means the approvable_type and approvable_id columns store the necessary link. Records related to EmailApplication will become orphaned or need to be selectively deleted if historical approval data for email applications is not required.



Action Plan:



Create a new migration: php artisan make:migration remove_email_provisioning_components



Inside the migration's up() method:



Drop the email_applications table: Schema::dropIfExists('email_applications');



Remove specific columns from users table if confirmed they are not used elsewhere:



PHP



Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {



    if (Schema::hasColumn('users', 'motac_email')) {



        $table->dropUnique(['motac_email']); // Drop unique constraint first



        $table->dropColumn('motac_email');



    }



    if (Schema::hasColumn('users', 'user_id_assigned')) {



        $table->dropUnique(['user_id_assigned']); // Drop unique constraint first



        $table->dropColumn('user_id_assigned');



    }



    // Consider other fields like previous_department_name, previous_department_email, service_status, appointment_type



    // If they are purely for email app and not general HR, drop them.



    if (Schema::hasColumn('users', 'previous_department_name')) $table->dropColumn('previous_department_name');



    if (Schema::hasColumn('users', 'previous_department_email')) $table->dropColumn('previous_department_email');



    if (Schema::hasColumn('users', 'service_status')) $table->dropColumn('service_status');



    if (Schema::hasColumn('users', 'appointment_type')) $table->dropColumn('appointment_type');



});











Handle approvals table: Decide on historical data.



Option A (Delete associated history): DB::table('approvals')->where('approvable_type', 'App\Models\EmailApplication')->delete(); (Run before dropping email_applications table to ensure relationships are handled cleanly, or use a separate migration specifically for data cleanup if the table is already dropped).



Option B (Keep orphaned history for audit): If historical approval records are needed for audit purposes, leave them. The foreign key constraint won't break if approvable_id is not strictly enforced on the id of email_applications table (which it wouldn't be for polymorphic relations).

        Route::get('/', App\Livewire\Helpdesk\MyTicketsIndex::class)->name('index');



        Route::get('/create', App\Livewire\Helpdesk\CreateTicketForm::class)->name('create');



        Route::get('/{ticket}', App\Livewire\Helpdesk\TicketDetails::class)->name('show');



        // Admin routes for managing tickets



        Route::middleware(['role:Admin|IT Admin'])->group(function () {



            Route::get('/admin/tickets', App\Livewire\Helpdesk\Admin\TicketManagement::class)->name('admin.index');



            // Add other admin-specific routes (e.g., reports)



        });



    });



});

Phase 4: Testing, Deployment, and Documentation



Unit Testing:



Create comprehensive unit tests for all new Helpdesk models, services, policies, and controllers.



Ensure existing ICT Loan unit tests still pass after refactoring.



Feature/Integration Testing:



Write feature tests for all Helpdesk user flows (creating, viewing, commenting, updating, assigning tickets).



Execute existing ICT Loan feature tests to ensure no regressions.



Test the overall system integration, ensuring navigation and data flow between ICT Loan and Helpdesk (if any) are seamless.



Test authorization and role-based access control for both modules.



User Acceptance Testing (UAT):



Engage key stakeholders (users, IT staff, BPM staff) to test the new Helpdesk system and confirm the removal of Email Provisioning. Gather feedback for any necessary adjustments.



Deployment Strategy:



Database Migrations: Ensure all new migrations are correctly applied to production. Consider data seeding for initial categories/priorities.



Code Deployment: Use CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions as mentioned in System Design) to deploy the new v4.0 branch to staging/production environments.



Rollback Plan: Have a clear rollback plan in case of unforeseen issues.



Documentation & Training:



Update System Design Document: Create a "System Design (Rev. 4.0)" document reflecting the removed email module, new Helpdesk module, and any updated architecture.



Update README.md: Reflect the changes (removal of email provisioning, addition of helpdesk).



User Manuals: Update user manuals for both the ICT Loan and the new Helpdesk functionalities.



Training: Conduct training sessions for end-users and IT support staff on the new Helpdesk system and changes to existing workflows.



This detailed plan provides a structured approach to achieve the desired system evolution to Version 4.0, ensuring a smooth transition and robust new functionality.
