The **MOTAC Integrated Resource Management System** is a web application designed to streamline and consolidate two key operational areas for the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (MOTAC), Malaysia: Email/User ID Provisioning and ICT Equipment Loan Management. It provides a unified, Laravel-based platform to optimize workflows, enforce business rules, and ensure a consistent user experience.

This system aims to enhance efficiency through automated processes, centralized data management, role-based access, real-time notifications, and comprehensive reporting capabilities tailored to MOTAC's specific needs.

### Built With
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
* [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com)

## Features

- **Email/User ID Provisioning Management:** Automates the application, certification, approval, and provisioning process for official MOTAC email accounts and user IDs, mirroring existing MyMail application workflows.
- **ICT Equipment Loan Management:** Facilitates the request, approval, issuance, tracking, and return of ICT equipment (laptops, projectors, etc.) for official use.
- **Unified Data Management:** Consolidates user data, applications, approvals, equipment inventory, and notifications in a single MySQL database.
- **Streamlined Workflows & Process Automation:** Automates and standardizes application and approval processes, reducing administrative burdens.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Security:** Ensures users, approvers, BPM staff, and IT Admins have appropriate access levels with robust security measures, including grade-based approval logic. Standardized role names (e.g., 'Admin', 'BPM Staff', 'IT Admin') are utilized.
- **User and Organizational Data Management:** Maintains centralized records of system users, including their department, position, and grade, crucial for workflows and approvals.
- **Dynamic Forms:** Utilizes Livewire for complex, dynamic application forms, such as replicating the conditional field logic of the MyMail application form.
- **Real-Time Reporting & Notifications:** Enables insights into resource utilization and application statuses. Users are notified of critical events via email and in-app (database) notifications.
- **ICT Equipment Inventory Management:** Manages a detailed inventory of ICT equipment, including categories, sub-categories, locations, and status.
- **Audit Trails:** Automatically records user actions for key data (created_by, updated_by) for accountability and tracking.
- **Support for Localization:** Adapts the system for use in Bahasa Melayu as the primary language, including UI text and date formats. The system architecture supports language switching.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- PHP 8.1 or later.
- Composer.
- MySQL.

### Installation

1.  Download the source code using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/IzzatFirdaus/MOTAC_ICT_LOAN_HRMS]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd MOTAC_Integrated_Resource_Management_System # Or your chosen project folder name
    ```
3.  Install dependencies using Composer:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
4.  Set up the database and necessary configurations:
    * Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` file in the root of your project.
    * Open the `.env` file in the root of your project.
    * Set the database connection details: `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`.
    * Set the `APP_URL` to your application's URL.
    * Set the `APP_TIMEZONE` to 'Asia/Kuala_Lumpur'.
    * Configure `MAIL_MAILER` and other mail settings as per `config/mail.php` for notifications.
5.  Run the key generate command:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
6.  Run the storage link command:
    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```
7.  Run the migration command. It is recommended to use specific seeders developed for the MOTAC system to populate necessary data like departments, grades, roles, equipment categories, etc.
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate # Add --seed if MOTAC-specific seeders are available
    ```
8.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
9.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or your configured `APP_URL`) to see the application.

### Default Admin Usage (Example)
The system uses role-based access. Initial administrative users should be created through seeding or a designated registration process defined by MOTAC. For development, if based on the original HRMS template, example credentials might be:
    ```bash
    email: admin@demo.com
    password: admin
    ```
    *(Note: These credentials are for illustrative purposes if derived from the base template. Actual admin credentials for the MOTAC system will be established during setup and should be kept secure.)*
