     * App\Livewire\Settings\Departments\Index (aliased as SettingsDepartmentsIndexLW in web.php).
     * This Livewire component provides the UI and handles the underlying logic for CRUD operations,
     * making traditional controller methods for these actions redundant in this context.
     *
     * If any specific, non-CRUD administrative actions related to departments are needed
     * that are NOT handled by the aforementioned Livewire component (e.g., a bulk import/export,
     * or a special report not covered by the reporting module), they could be added here
     * with their own dedicated route definitions.
     *
     * System Design Reference: indicates a shift to Livewire for such entities.
