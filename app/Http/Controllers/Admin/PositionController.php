     * making traditional controller methods for these actions redundant in this context.

     * The web.php has been updated to route settings.positions.index to this Livewire component.

     * If any specific, non-CRUD administrative actions related to positions are needed that
     * are NOT handled by the Livewire component, they could be added here.
