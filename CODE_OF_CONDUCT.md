# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior Examples

- Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward others
- Respect differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback
- Accept responsibility and apologize for mistakes, learning from the experience
- Focus on what is best for the community as a whole

### Unacceptable Behavior Examples

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments; personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (e.g., physical or email address) without explicit permission
- Any other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Reasons for moderation decisions will be communicated when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a community representative at events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the enforcement team at [amralsaleeh@outlook.com](mailto:amralsaleeh@outlook.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The privacy and security of the reporter will be respected.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines when determining consequences for violations:

### 1. Correction

**Consequence:** Private, written warning with clarity about the violation and explanation of why it was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Consequence:** Warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the affected people, including unsolicited interaction with enforcement team members, for a specified period. Further violation may result in a ban.
